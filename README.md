### Hi! I'm Neil McGlohon

- ðŸ’¬ I am a research scientist at IBM Research in Almaden.
While my team is based in the Bay Area, I work remotely from Troy, NY.
I work on the brain-inspired computing team which provides me with interesting and unique challenges to learn from.


- ðŸ˜… 99% of my activity is committed to IBM's self-hosted GitHub Enterprise server which does not report activity to public GitHub.
